RAPID DEVELOPMENT is for STARTUP.
Indexing:
	Phone book is indexed with last_name. so it's sorted and can be scanned with last_name.
	B-Tree(Balanced Tree)
		leaf nodes are doubly linked list
		everynode {
			VALUE
			ROWID
		}
	Index writing slower because the B-Tree must be balanced on every insert.
