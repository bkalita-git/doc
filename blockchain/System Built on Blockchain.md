## System 0: Generalized Blockchain Network

Nodes will run a special program in a p2p network called miners. Miners maintain the blockchain. using another application called client, it can submit a transaction to that p2p network and miners will verify the transcation and will add to the blockchain.

## System 1: BitCoin

Bitcoin is just used for transcation.

## System 2: Ethereum

```
Platform : Ethereum
Used for : Making Decentralized Apps and NFTs and DeFi
Contract can be written in : Solidity, which will get exucuted in all the computers who installed your DAPP.
CryptoCurrency : Ether or simple Eth
```

1. EVM (Etherium Virtual Machine)  
   **EVM** is the part of the GAS Software. **GAS** is the Implementation of Ethereum Protocol. There are other implementations like OpenEthereum. So, **etherum network** is bunch of computers runnung GAS. Also it can be said that those EVM are Distributed State Machine and they executes Byte Code. SO developer programs in **SOLIDITY** and then it's compiled to byte code and it is distributed/deployed to all those computers running GAS. When Transaction calls **smart contract** and that changes the state of the blockchain.

2. Who will run the EVM?

   Miners. it is possible to submit a transaction without directly using EVM but just using a client who can access ethereum network and then the EVM on that network will process that transaction and then add it to the blockchain.

3. Application on ethereum
   - NFT

## System 2: CARDANO

Proof of stake cryptocurrency.

## Difference between Bitcoin and EThereum

Bitcoin also has miners so it can be access without have the mining software. But there is no smart contract in bitcoin.
