Memory Models

heap stack code-section
Because, Array is the only one which is going to implemented in memory exactly. 

Stack is a logical model, which is implemented by array and linked list.

Table is a logical model, which is implemented by array.

Linked List is a logical model which is implemented by self-referential structure variable. 


A collection of continous memory locations, all these locations are side by side. 

This array will have fixed size, once it is created of some size, then that size cannot be increased or decreased. 

The size of array is fixed.

An array can be created either inside stack or heap.
