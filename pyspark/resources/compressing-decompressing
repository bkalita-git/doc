serialization, marshalling, flattening, pickling

Serialization: JSON is a "text serialization" format, it outputs unicode, most of the time encoded to utf-8
pickle: is a binary serialization format. can be used to serialize almost any python objects.
marshalling: Marshal Serializer also serializes objects and faster than pickle but it supports fewer datatypes.
Java Object Serialization: convert java object to byte not class
kryo serialization: 



What gets serialized in spark.
 1. the function being passed to rdd.map(function) itself need to be serialized since "function" itself an object.
 2. if references to other objects are made within the "function" then those objects need to be serialized too.


rdd = spark.read.format("csv")...load()
 1. the csv is read only by DRIVER-JVM
 2. Partition are serialzed and sent to Executor-JVM.
rdd.map(function)
 1. here, "function" is serialized by PythonDriver(not JVM-DRIVER)
 2. rdd_partition is serialized by EXECUTOR-JVM
 
 
 The thing under UI is simply wholeStageCodegen, not an Action.
