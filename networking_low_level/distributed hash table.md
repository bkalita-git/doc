## peer discovery

mDNS and DHT

## multicast DNS (mDNS) and a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).

mDNS doesnâ€™t work over the internet and DHT does. DHT requires BOOTSTRAP NODE. Other nodes can join the network by connecting to a bootstrapping node, and then discover the rest of the network. the BOOTSTRAP NODE must be accessible from public.
